Hi, I’m Alex 👋 — based in Finland :flag_finland: :flag_european_union:

I like simple, practical solutions — less is more.
My thinking is grounded in a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics.

🧠 **Engineering philosophy**
- simplicity beats unnecessary abstraction
- optimization matters only when it becomes relevant
- prefer built-in, well-supported solutions over custom complexity
- adopting new, genuinely useful technologies is how you gain an edge
- modern tools should reduce cognitive load, not increase it

🔍 **Current interests**
- AI-assisted development workflows that create real leverage
- unit testing and mocking as a simple way to maintain correctness,
  and as a fast feedback loop for agentic development
- algorithms and approaches that improve asymptotic system performance

🛠️ **Go-to stack**
- C# / .NET — expressive, pleasant to use, backed by a strong ecosystem
- TypeScript — frontend; most familiar with Angular
- Azure — cloud infrastructure and managed services that remove accidental complexity (Durable functions, SQL, Storage, etc.)
- Python or TypeScript — scripting, automation, and glue code
- PowerShell — CLI wrappers and OS-level automation

#### 🌱 Open source

I enjoy giving back to open-source projects, even in small but meaningful ways —
answering [questions](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/issues/2468), writing clear issue [reports](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask/issues/1215) and assisting in [triaging](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/2043#issuecomment-3101281586), improving [documentation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/9086),
fixing [typos](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/51130), [localizing](https://github.com/Tillerino/Tillerinobot/pull/32) and submitting small [PRs](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/pull/5870) based on my experience running the tools.
I also encourage peers to participate and help lower the barrier to contributing.
I publish my own [tools](https://github.com/firedigger/linkedin-resume-parser) and minimal
reproductions of useful [findings](https://github.com/firedigger/AzureMarketplaceIntegrationSample) from commercial work, released under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org).

🤝 I mentor engineers, share knowledge, and help people grow into confident decision-makers.

🌍 Outside of engineering, I follow current affairs and enjoy thinking about
how technology, economics, and policy interact.
